# Notes for devs

## Building and testing

Run `npm install` to grab all necessary dependencies. Then `npm run dev` will start a localhost server on port 8080 with Instant Preview.

_Testing steps TBD_

## API 

The /pages/api directory should be self explanatory, but the /apitester page has some quick and dirty API calls to check if the system is online. The Oracle Autonomous Database system will be brought back online one I finish authentication and user handling.
