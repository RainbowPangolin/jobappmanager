# Job Management App (Working title)

A React app to sort, manage, and track a job seeker's applications. The latest deployment can be found at https://jobappmanager.vercel.app/ 


## Overview

This project was primarily made as an excuse to learn React, Next.js, and get better with CSS and building REST APIs. I also wanted to include some features on this app that you wouldn't be able to get from just using one of the popular document writers. 

If you're looking for a job, and sending many applications, it's easy to lose track of where you've applied. And if you do eventually hear back from a prospective employer, the job posting you applied for is often removed. This app is meant to help you manage your applications to see what stage of the hiring process you are with each potential employer. It also has some (in progress) features to help you stay motivated and accountable when searching.

## Features

- **Sorted job application management table**. Once you submit an application, you can enter in the information in the "Add job" section and it will be appended to your locally saved list of applications.
- **(In Progress) Authentication and cloud saving**. You will be able to create an account profile, and login from anywhere to see your applications. Currently, the backend is set up and ready for cloud saving- I just need to set up the authentication layer before I bring it online. 
- **(In Progress) Activity Tracker**. The app will track how many applications you submit and how often.
- **(Planned) Chrome Extension Port**. Once I have the basic infrastructure of the app working, I will port (or potentially rebuild) the app as a Chrome and/or Firefox extension.
